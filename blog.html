                The only challege that I had was uploading my site to OSU. 
                I solved this problem by clicking on the link in the readme file provided by the professor.

                The things I heard from this assignment was how to structure a website. 
                In anaddiction to that I didn't know that the head tag doesn't show up on your website. 
                That is something really useful to know. Before this assignment the things that I already 
                knew were the tags what what they did. Overall this assignment helped put things in the right place.

                The things that I used to help me with this assignment was the professor's online notes that he posted for HTML.
                With just that I was able to do this assignment. All I did was read the notes and I was able to understand what was going on.
