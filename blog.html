                The only challege that I had was uploading my site to OSU. 
                I solved this problem by clicking on the link in the readme file provided by the professor.

                The things I heard from this assignment was how to structure a website. 
                In anaddiction to that I didn't know that the head tag doesn't show up on your website. 
                That is something really useful to know. Before this assignment the things that I already 
                knew were the tags what what they did. Overall this assignment helped put things in the right place.

                The things that I used to help me with this assignment was the professor's online notes that he posted for HTML.
                With just that I was able to do this assignment. All I did was read the notes and I was able to understand what was going on.

                The most challeging part of this assignment was alignment of the box in the correct places. One problem that I
                had was the post containers weren't exactly straight.
                Everything was straight except for the second to last one of each two. To find this problem I used inline-flex
                instead of inline-block.
            </li>
            <li>
                Everything fromt his assignment was new to me. I learned how to style certain things by order. I also learned
                learned many ways to align things the way you want it.
                Some special insights that I had was that you can change all the same elements which makes things more
                efficients.
                The only thing that I knew was changing the height and changing the width.
            </li>

                The resources I used to do this assignment was stackoverflow, peers, and W3schools which has a good source code
                which you can play around with.
            </li>
            <li>
                The things I had to google were:
                <ul>
                    <li> to make increase a size of the button when increasing?( which used the scale function)</li>
                    <li>How does the fas fa-plus icon work?</li>
                </ul>
                
            </li>
