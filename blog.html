                The only challege that I had was uploading my site to OSU. 
                I solved this problem by clicking on the link in the readme file provided by the professor.
            </li>
            <li>
                The things I heard from this assignment was how to structure a website. 
                In anaddiction to that I didn't know that the head tag doesn't show up on your website. 
                That is something really useful to know. Before this assignment the things that I already 
                knew were the tags what what they did. Overall this assignment helped put things in the right place.
            </li>
            <li>
                The things that I used to help me with this assignment was the professor's online notes that he posted for HTML.
                With just that I was able to do this assignment. All I did was read the notes and I was able to understand what was going on. 
            </li>

            <li>
                The most challeging part of this assignment was alignment of the box in the correct places. One problem that I
                had was the post containers weren't exactly straight.
                Everything was straight except for the second to last one of each two. To find this problem I used inline-flex
                instead of inline-block.
            </li>
            <li>
                Everything fromt his assignment was new to me. I learned how to style certain things by order. I also learned
                learned many ways to align things the way you want it.
                Some special insights that I had was that you can change all the same elements which makes things more
                efficients.
                The only thing that I knew was changing the height and changing the width.
            </li>
            <li>
                The resources I used to do this assignment was stackoverflow, peers, and W3schools which has a good source code
                which you can play around with.
            </li>
            <li>
                The things I had to google were:
                <ul>
                    <li> to make increase a size of the button when increasing?( which used the scale function)</li>
                    <li>How does the fas fa-plus icon work?</li>
                </ul>
                
            </li>

        <ol>

                The challenging thing about this assignment was that filtering wasn't so straightforward. At first I was trynna to figure out what is that approach to this 
                problem, but I was just overthinking a simple solution. At first I was making nested condition statements but that just got chaotic and it wasn't right.
            </li>
            <li>
                The thing I learned from this assignment was how to use JavaScript. Before this assignment I didn't know anything about it. I didn't know before this assignment
                unless it was HTML or CSS. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The resources that I used to get this assignment done was stackoverflow and some youtube videos on how to do certain things. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <ul>

            <li>
                The most challenging thing about this assignment was the conditional statements of the handlebars. A special insight that I had was reading the documentions for the handlebars.
                I fixed this problem by adding more conditional statements in my handlebars. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The thing that I learned from this assigment was how to make my code more efficient by rendering templates. The thing that I already knew was nothing. Everything from this assigment was new to me. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The resources that were useful in this assignment was the recorded lectures and reading the documentions for the handlebars. The websites for the documents were the ones provided on the class websites.
