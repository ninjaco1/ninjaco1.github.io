                I am interesting about me is that I get injuried for the dumbest reasons.
                One time my car was parked on a slope and when I got to the car,
                I opened the car door but it swung open then there become a cut under my eye.
                Another time was went I swung my tennis racquet and it made a cut right next to my eye,
                so I had to get my eye glued.
